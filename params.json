You should thank Thomas Silkjær\r\nfor this one.\r\n\r\n### Clear Paragraph Overrides\r\nWith this script you can choose to clear all paragraph overrides in the document, or only clear overrides of selected paragraph styles.\r\n\r\n### Document Frames to Bleed\r\nThis script will expand or contract rectangles (picture frames) to the bleed of the parent page.\r\nTo fit the selected frame only see _Frame to Bleed_ below.\r\n\r\n### Export Book\r\nExports all stories in an InDesign document or book. It will only run the book script if no InDesign documents are open. This script is based on the awesome ExportAllText.jsx from Olav Kvern.\r\n\r\n### Find Master\r\nGo to the next page the selected master is applied to. Save preferences functionality powered by Scott Zanelli (Thank you!) Keyboard shortcut preference ctrl-M\r\n\r\n### Fore-Edge Bleeder\r\nPlace selected files in outside margin to create a fore-edge bleed. A fore-edge bleed is similar to a [fore-edge painting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fore-edge_painting) but in this case the image is created by printing it on the die and will become visible when the book-block is cut.\r\n\r\n### Frame to Bleed\r\nThis script will expand or contract the selected rectangle (picture frame) to the bleed of the parent page. To fit all the frames in your document see _Document Frames to Bleed_ above.\r\n\r\n### Frame to Margin\r\nThis script will expand or contract the selected frame (Text frame) to the margin of the parent page.\r\n\r\n### Get DPI Based Dimensions\r\nThis script safes the actual file dimensions (in mm) of selected image files in Adobe Bridge to a text-file on given location. Just select some files in Adobe Bridge and run the script.\r\n\r\n### Glyph Replacer\r\nWith this script you can replace the characters of a font with pictures. It is the closest thing to [Photofont](http://www.photofont.com/) we have today. The script needs a folder containing psd files (glyphs) that carry the unicode decimal number of the character it represent. For example: 65.psd would link to a Capital A. Every font folder needs at least the unicode replacement character: 65533.psd which will be used when a character is not found. When you replace characters with pictures keep in mind that the script does not know anything about hyphenation... You do however keep the ability to kern, track or change the leading.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for decimal [codepoints](http://codepoints.net/), I love using [UnicodeChecker](http://earthlingsoft.net/UnicodeChecker/). \r\n\r\n### Grid Division\r\nReturns value of grid division as edit-text for you to copy.\r\n\r\n### Margin to Grid\r\nThis script aligns the margins to the grid.\r\n_note this only works with grids that are a division of pagesize_\r\n\r\n### Margin to Style\r\nA script to apply the selected master-page to any page that contains the selected paragraph style.\r\n\r\n### Multi Page Importer\r\nThis awesome script from Scott Zanelli is the best way to import PDFs or InDesign natives into InDesign. This tool is similar to _Place Files On Pages_ below\r\n\r\n### Optical Margin Batch\r\nApply optical margin to all stories in the document\r\n\r\n### Orphan Fixer\r\nAvoid orphans by applying a no-break style to the last space in paragraphs.\r\n\r\n### Pair Paragraph Styles\r\nFix paragraph style combinations with this tool by Thomas Silkjær\r\n\r\n### Place Files On Pages\r\nA comic book helper. It places pages as Image or PDF into a book, you can choose to size the art and scale down to bleed, page or margin. If you need more controle of placing PDFs or InDesign files _Multi Page Importer_ above is really good.\r\n\r\n### Read Actual Margins\r\nThe margins window showes three decimal places. Under the hood however the margins could be set (by a script) to way more decimal pages. This script shows the actual unrounded margins with the option to round them. This should fix the ‘Unable to create boundingbox’ error.\r\n\r\n### Remove Frame Rotation\r\nMoves the rotation of frames to it’s contents. This way you end up with rotated content in stead of rotated frames.\r\n\r\n### Remove All Guides\r\nA small tool to clear all guides in one go.\r\n\r\n### Replace Master\r\nSwap one master-page for another.\r\n\r\n\r\n______________________________________\r\n\r\n#### Support or Contribute?\r\nContact mail@brunoherfst.com and we’ll sort it out.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
